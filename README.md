# scryfall API advanced
 An advanced version of my work with the scryfall API making both use of their online API to give access to more information and more options for how the application works compared to the older versions i made.

## changes made
in the start of the project i made use of downloaded bulk data that i could only have in a zip file on Gihub beacus of the file size. The data from the file would be fetched and then filted before being added to the application. I removed it after i found a much more effective way of doing it making use of the Apiâ€™s page function
