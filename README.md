# scryfall API advanced
 An advanced version of my work with the scryfall API making both use of their online API and downloaded bulk data to give access to more information and more options for how the application works

## Made with
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Select2
- jQuery
- API

## Plans for the future
I plan to later remake the application to make use of JavaScript modules for ease of development.
