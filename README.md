# scryfall API advanced
 An advanced version of my work with the scryfall API making both use of their online API and downloaded bulk data to give access to more information and more options for how the application works

## How it works
1. Start by unzipping Bulk_data.zip
   * The reason that the data is stored in a zip is because of Git and GitHub is not capable of managing the large file size without extra work and payments so since this is a hobby project I decided to just zip the files instead.
